Lab 11: 7 May 2024
Attendees: Everyone

Since the last meeting, the following progressions have been made: 
- The timer module is complete: the LED lights on the STM32 start completely lit up and progressively turn off as the timer runs out, at which point the lights will flash quickly in some pattern. 
- The serial module is complete: the program recieves a distance (the results of the player's turn) and returns the points scored by the player. 

In today's lab we worked on progressing through the assignment modules, with the intention of doing our integration next week.
