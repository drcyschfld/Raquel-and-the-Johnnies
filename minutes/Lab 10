Lab 10 Minutes:

Tuesday, 30th April

Attendees: Darcy Schofield, Natalie Brown, Raquel Kampel, Axel Purcell

- In this lab, we presented our ideas to the tutors for discussion and approval.
- We had compiled a google doc throughout the week with our various ideas for games.
- After discussion with Michael, we decided on our 'bowling' idea, using the PTU to roll a ball down an alleyway to gain points.

Design Modules:

- Mechanical design (Physical Environment - ramp, alley, ball)
- Potentiometer to dicate the desired angle of the ramp (attached to PTU)
- PTU rotating to desired release angle 
- Servo motor to release gate holding ball 
- Lidar to read distance travelled
- Sensor (demoed in Week 10 lecture) to provide 'cosmetic' indication of how close the ball is to the target distance
- Timer interface with LEDs to display time running out 
- Serial point system with UI display


Action Items:
* Get the PTU working with a potentionmeter to control rotation.
* Delegate modules and work on functionality of individual modules 
* Complete mechanical design BEFORE the next lab. I.e., create the alleyway and ramp. Decide on a ball to roll. 

We will meet on Friday (3/5) to work on the task further.
